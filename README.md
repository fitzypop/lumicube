# LumiCube

A collection of scripts to run on lumicube.

I'm looking for a vscode extension, or this might be a good chance to make my own extension?

Anyway, these scripts are written in the lumicube editor and saved in this repo.

## How to use

Setup and turn on your lumicube.

If everything is correct, you should see an ip address displayed on the back screen.

Open your browser and goto that IP address.

You'll see the Abstract Factory Editor page, use that to update your lumicube script.
